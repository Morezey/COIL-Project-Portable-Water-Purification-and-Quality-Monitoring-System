# Solar-Powered Water Purification & Quality Monitoring System

**Project Status:** Active | **Current Release:** Version 4 (Final Design)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements an automated water purification system with real-time quality monitoring. It features two distinct hardware configurations:
1.  **Scaled System (Part A):** High-capacity community unit (Seaflo Pump, 4-Stage Filtration + UV, solar powered).
2.  **Miniaturized System (Part B):** Portable tactical unit (R385 Pump, UF Membrane, Battery Powered).
