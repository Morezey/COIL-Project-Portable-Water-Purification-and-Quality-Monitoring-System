# Solar-Powered Water Purification & Quality Monitoring System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the complete design and source files for an automated, off-grid water purification system. The project integrates multi-stage filtration, UV disinfection, and real-time water quality monitoring (Turbidity, pH, TDS) using an ESP32 microcontroller and solar power.
